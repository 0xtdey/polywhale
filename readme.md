This would be a standalone app that can run locally on linux.
The app would run in the background and would fetch new whale tx every 5 minutes and display it in the notification bar. Simple & clean ux.

The goal of this app is simple that is to send a notification for every whale transaction that happens on polymarket. 

When user opens the app for the first time, most of the time it is understandable that there is no whale transaction to display immediately after opening the account. In that case the app would try to fetch any whale tx on polymarket from the last 24hrs and display. 

in case, in the last 24 hours there is no whale transaction the app would try to fetch whale tx from last 7 days and display. 

In the notification it would display basic information like tx hash, tx amount, market name etc etc but when user comes in the app it would open up a list of all whale txs and user can click on any tx to see more details.
